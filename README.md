# robot-collision-prediction
This project simulates a robot navigating a 2D environment and uses a neural network (PyTorch-based) to predict whether a chosen action will result in a collision with walls. It combines physics simulation (Pymunk), visualization (Pygame), and machine learning for intelligent behavior evaluation.
